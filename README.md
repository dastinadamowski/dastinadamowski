# Hi, I'm Dastin 👋

**Product Builder | Fractional CPO | AI Agent Orchestrator**

I bridge the gap between **radical product vision** and **technical execution**.
I don't just manage backlogs; I architect systems, automate workflows, and ship products that scale. My work spans **AI Agents**, **Web3 Protocols**, **DeFi primitives**, and **Consumer Apps**.

I believe reality has changed: the modern Product Manager must be a builder. I use AI swarms to validate ideas in hours and ship MVPs in weeks, not months.

### 🛠 What I Build & Ship
* **Web3 Ecosystems:** From L1 blockchains to consumer crypto neobanks (ex-**MELD**, ex-**Worldcoin**).
* **AI Ops & Agents:** Building internal "operating systems" using **n8n**, **LLMs**, and agentic swarms to automate 60%+ of operational overhead.
* **DeFi Protocols:** Intent-based routing, cross-chain yield strategies, and self-repaying lending vaults.
* **Growth Engines:** Scaling products from 0 to **200k+ users** via data-driven UX and global on/off-ramp integrations.

### 🧠 My Philosophy: "The Singularity Sprint"
We are in a 3-4 year window where individual leverage outweighs institutional size.
* **Old Way:** Plan → Spec → Build → Test → Ship (Months)
* **My Way:** Talk → Decide → **Vibe Code/Prototype** → Iterate (Hours/Days)
